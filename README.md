With a focus on clean design, user experience, and functionality, I am building a responsive and modern website that highlights the creativity and expertise that Lopeseco Design Studio  brings to its clients. This repo contains the code, designs, and resources used in the process.

I'm excited to continue improving the website and showcasing the unique work that my husband and his talented team produce!
